# Work-Day-Scheduler
This is my Challenge 5 assignment for the coding boot camp. It is a scheduler to help you keep up with your daily tasks.

Usage: The use of this is that you can enter in your day to day schedule and track the events in real time.

Credits: The only collaboration I had was from my wonderful classmates.
